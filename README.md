## Animated Octo Barnacle

An attempt at constructing a [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) parser with Antlr4.

### Motivation

Been a long time single I took up the dynamic symbol table pattern.

### Goals

- [x] Use ant + ivy for the java target
- [ ] Establish Continuous Integration
- [ ] Flex and Bison Runtime
- [ ] Possible Antlr4 C# Runtime

Just complete the model with proper test cases.

### Why the name?

This repo was created during this [outage](https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1058398116133683200), the name kinda stuck from that.
